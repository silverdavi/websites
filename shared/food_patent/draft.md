# **STRATEGIC INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY REPORT: AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR GRANULAR STARCH PROCESSING VIA HYDRO-THERMAL AGITATION**

## **1\. Executive Summary: The Convergence of Artisanal Physics and Industrial Automation**

The global food processing industry stands at a technological bifurcation point regarding the preparation of granular starch-based staples, specifically couscous, bulgur, and complex rice dishes like biryani. On one side exists the industrial paradigm: high-throughput extrusion and steam-tunnel drying lines, exemplified by machinery from manufacturers like Clextral and Fava Storci.1 These systems prioritize caloric throughput and shelf-stability, producing "instant" varieties that are pre-gelatinized but often suffer from textural homogeneity and a lack of granular integrity. On the other side lies the domestic appliance market, dominated by "dump-and-stir" robotic cookers (e.g., Thermomix, Instant Pot) and passive steam devices (rice cookers). These devices fail to replicate the complex mechanical and thermodynamic interventions—specifically the "roulage" (rolling) and "fluffing"—required to produce artisan-quality couscous.3

This report details a novel proprietary platform, tentatively designated the **"Hydro-Thermal Agitation System" (HTAS)**, which bridges this gap. By synthesizing **microwave dielectric heating**, **perimeter-targeted fluid injection**, and **vertical reciprocating agitation**, the HTAS automates the artisanal logic of starch preparation. The system is designed to manage the glass transition ($T\_g$) and gelatinization kinetics of durum wheat semolina in a non-submerged environment, preventing the formation of the "unitary doughy mass" characteristic of standard automated attempts.

The commercial and intellectual property (IP) strategy outlined herein targets a broad claim structure. While the primary embodiment focuses on the "Perfect Couscous" method—achieving a 10/10 textural score by replicating hand-rolling—the underlying hardware claims extend to any granular food requiring precise moisture control and low-shear agitation. This includes automated layering for **Dum Biryani**, high-impact processing for **Mochi**, and longitudinal stretching for **Noodles**. The roadmap culminates in a "Smart Kitchen" data play, where rheological feedback from the agitator serves as a real-time sensor for food doneness, creating a defendable barrier to entry for competitors.

**2\. Technical Field and Background of the Invention**

### **2.1 The Physicochemical Challenge of Granular Starch**

The preparation of couscous is fundamentally a problem of **controlled hydration and agglomeration prevention**. Durum wheat semolina consists of protein-encapsulated starch granules. When exposed to water and heat (gelatinization), the starch granules swell, and amylose leaks onto the surface. In a submerged environment (boiling), this amylose disperses into the bulk liquid. However, in a "steam" or "absorption" environment—typical of couscous—the liquid volume is limited. If the granules are in static contact during gelatinization, the surface amylose acts as an adhesive, fusing the granules into a solid cake or "clump".5

Traditional artisanal methods counteract this via a multi-stage process:

1. **Lipid Coating:** Oil is rubbed into the dry grains to limit water diffusivity.  
2. **Incremental Hydration:** Water is added in small aliquots to prevent saturation of the surface before the core hydrates.  
3. **Mechanical "Fluffing":** Repeated physical separation breaks the capillary bridges between granules before the amylose network sets.

### **2.2 Limitations of Prior Art**

A comprehensive review of the patent landscape reveals significant gaps in reproducing this mechanical-thermodynamic cycle.

#### **2.2.1 Industrial Extrusion Systems**

Patents such as **US5427809A** (North Dakota State University) describe the dominant industrial method: extrusion.6 Here, semolina is hydrated to form a dough, extruded through a die plate, and cut. While this creates uniform shapes, it essentially creates "pasta pellets" rather than agglomerated granules. The high pressure of extrusion shears the protein network, resulting in a denser, chewier particle that lacks the light, fluffy porosity of traditional rolled couscous. Furthermore, industrial lines rely on massive rotary dryers and steam tunnels 1, technologies that are irreducible to a countertop footprint and economically unviable for restaurant-scale on-demand production.

#### **2.2.2 Domestic Multi-Cookers and Mixers**

The domestic market relies on devices like the Thermomix or standard rice cookers, which suffer from orthogonal limitations:

* **Rotary Shear Damage:** Devices with bottom-mounted rotary blades (e.g., Thermomix) rely on high rotational speeds to mix. When applied to a semi-solid mass of hydrated semolina, this creates high shear stress, fracturing the swollen granules and releasing excessive starch. The result is a sticky, cohesive paste rather than distinct grains.3  
* **Passive Steaming:** Rice cookers 7 rely on passive water absorption. They lack an active mechanism to break the inter-granular bonds that form during the "tacky" phase of gelatinization. Without the "fluffing" action, the weight of the upper layers compresses the lower layers into a dense cake.4  
* **Microwave Unevenness:** Standard microwave cooking of particulates is plagued by the "hot spot/cold spot" phenomenon caused by standing waves in the cavity. In a granular bed, this leads to some areas desiccating (burning) while others remain raw. The addition of bulk water often leads to "boil-over" before the dense semolina particles can hydrate to the core.5

### **2.3 The Unmet Need**

There is no existing apparatus that combines **in-situ mechanical separation** (fluffing) with **controlled electromagnetic energy deposition** (microwave) and **gradient hydration** (perimeter injection). The present invention fulfills this need, providing a platform for the "Staged Hydro-Thermal Agitation" of food.

## ---

**3\. The Core Science: Thermodynamic and Rheological Principles**

The "Hydro-Thermal Agitation System" is not merely a recipe automation; it is a reactor designed to manipulate the phase transitions of biopolymers. The success of the method rests on three scientific pillars: Lipid-Amylose Complexing, Radial Hydration Dynamics, and Active Retrogradation.

### **3.1 Lipid-Amylose Complex Formation (The Hydrophobic Barrier)**

The first stage of the process involves the "Lipid Pre-coating." Semolina is mixed with oil (approx. 1:5 v/v ratio) prior to significant water addition. Under the thermal influence of microwave radiation, this step is not trivial. Research indicates that microwave heating can facilitate the formation of **V-type amylose-lipid complexes**.5

* **Mechanism:** The hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids (from the oil) form inclusion complexes within the helical cavity of the amylose chains.  
* **Effect:** These complexes effectively "lock" the amylose, reducing its water solubility and its tendency to retrograde rapidly into a rigid gel. This creates a microscopic hydrophobic barrier on the surface of each granule.  
* **Process Consequence:** During the subsequent hydration phase, water must diffuse *through* this barrier. This slows the hydration rate, preventing the "flash swelling" of the surface that leads to mushiness, and forces a more uniform migration of moisture to the granule core. The result is a granule that is fully cooked but remains distinct and non-sticky.10

### **3.2 Radial Hydration Gradient (The "Centripetal Wick")**

Standard "dump-and-stir" methods create a vertical hydration gradient (wet bottom, dry top). The HTAS utilizes a **Circumferential Liquid Distribution Manifold** to create a *radial* gradient.7

* **The Physics of Microwave Heating:** Microwaves penetrate from the outside in, but the center of a cylindrical volume often focuses energy (the "caustic" effect), leading to overheating. However, evaporative cooling typically chills the surface.  
* **The Solution:** By injecting water along the *perimeter wall* of the vessel, the system achieves two thermal goals:  
  1. **Pre-heating:** As the water trickles down the microwave-transparent wall, it absorbs stray RF energy, heating up before it touches the food mass.  
  2. **Centripetal Wicking:** The dry granules at the center wick moisture from the wet periphery. This opposes the thermal gradient (where the center might be hotter), creating a balanced equilibrium. The water moves *towards* the heat, ensuring that the hottest part of the food (the center) receives moisture last, preventing it from boiling into a paste before the edges are cooked.

### **3.3 Active Retrogradation (The "Structure Lock")**

The final texture of couscous is determined not during heating, but during cooling. As gelatinized starch cools, the amylose chains re-associate (retrogradation).

* **Static Cooling:** If the mass cools while static, the amylose chains span across granule boundaries, welding them together.  
* **Dynamic Cooling:** The HTAS employs **Active Retrogradation Cooling**.12 By engaging the vertical agitator *while* blasting the chamber with cool air (or using a Peltier element), the system forces the starch to recrystallize while the granules are in motion. The inter-granular bridges are mechanically broken as they form. Consequently, the recrystallization occurs *intra-granularly* (within the particle), stiffening the individual grain, rather than *inter-granularly* (between particles). This is the physicochemical secret to the "10/10 light and separate texture."

**4\. Detailed Description of the Invention: The Apparatus**

The "Couscous-o-Matic" is conceptualized in two primary embodiments: a discrete countertop appliance for domestic/commercial use, and a continuous tunnel system for industrial production. Both rely on the same fundamental claim structure.

### **4.1 The Cooking Chamber and Vessel**

The apparatus comprises a shielded resonant cavity, optimized for 2.45 GHz microwave frequency. Unlike a standard rectangular cavity, the preferred embodiment may utilize a cylindrical or hexagonal geometry to optimize mode stirring and uniform field distribution.

* **The Vessel:** A removable container made of a low-loss dielectric material (e.g., borosilicate glass or high-performance thermoplastics like Ultem). The vessel geometry is critical: a slightly conical bottom facilitates the "centering" of dry granules under the influence of gravity, ensuring they fall back into the path of the agitator.14  
* **Surface Topology:** The interior walls are treated with a sol-gel ceramic hydrophobic coating to enhance the "wall-wetting" effect of the manifold and minimize frictional adhesion of the starch.

### **4.2 The Circumferential Liquid Distribution Manifold**

This component is the hydraulic heart of the system, designed to replace the "spray bar" of industrial lines 1 with a precision dosing ring.

* **Architecture:** An annular tube positioned at the superior rim of the vessel.15 It is fed by a peristaltic pump capable of precise volumetric delivery (±1 ml).  
* **Nozzle Vectoring:** The manifold features a plurality of micro-nozzles (e.g., 8-12) oriented at an incident angle of 15°–30° relative to the vessel wall vertical.  
* **Function:** The nozzles do not spray the food directly; they spray the *wall*. This creates a laminar falling film of water that encircles the food bed. This method prevents "cratering" or "divots" in the granule bed that direct spray would cause, preserving the bed density uniformity required for consistent microwave absorption.

### **4.3 The Multi-Mode Agitation Assembly**

To solve the shear-damage problem of rotary blades, the HTAS utilizes a **Vertical Reciprocating Agitator**.

* **Mechanism:** A "Fork" or "Rake" tool head is suspended from a central drive shaft. The drive mechanism, located outside the cavity, provides two degrees of freedom:  
  1. **Z-Axis Reciprocation:** A linear actuator drives the fork up and down (e.g., 1-5 Hz frequency).  
  2. **Theta-Axis Indexing:** A stepper motor rotates the fork incrementally (e.g., 15° per stroke).  
* **Mode A (Tumble/Coat):** Slow rotation with minimal vertical stroke. Used for lipid coating.  
* **Mode B (De-agglomeration):** High-frequency vertical strokes (3-5 Hz). The tines penetrate the cake, creating vertical "chimneys" for steam release and physically breaking nascent clumps.16 This mimics the "poking" action of a fork.  
* **Mode C (Lift/Fluff):** A "dip-twist-lift" motion. The tines descend, rotate to engage the lower layer, and lift it to the surface. This circulates the granules, ensuring that no single layer remains at the bottom (hottest) or top (driest) for too long.

### **4.4 Sensor Fusion and Smart Control**

The system is not blind; it uses a multi-variable feedback loop to determine "doneness."

* **Infrared Matrix:** A grid of IR sensors 17 maps the thermal topography of the food surface. If a "hot spot" develops (indicating local drying), the system can pause the microwave or target water injection (if the manifold has segmented control).  
* **Torque Rheometry:** The current draw of the agitator motors is monitored continuously.18  
  * *Phase 1 (Dry):* Low torque.  
  * *Phase 2 (Sticky/Gelatinization):* Torque increases as viscosity rises.  
  * *Phase 3 (Done/Fluffy):* Torque stabilizes or drops as granules separate.  
  * *Anomaly Detection:* A sudden spike in Z-axis resistance indicates a "crust" or "clump" formation. The controller responds by increasing agitation frequency (Aggressive De-agglomeration) to break the crust before it hardens.

### **4.5 The "Tunnel" Embodiment (Industrial Scaling)**

For factory applications, the batch vessel is replaced by a **Microwave-Transparent Conveyor Belt** moving through a tunnel.19

* **Transverse Agitation Gantries:** Instead of a rotary drum, the tunnel features overhead gantries equipped with transverse rows of vertical rakes. These rakes reciprocate up and down across the width of the belt.  
* **Sequential Zones:**  
  1. *Lipid Zone:* Spray nozzles apply oil; rakes tumble the grain.  
  2. *Hydration Zone 1:* Low-power microwave \+ Perimeter spray.  
  3. *Cook Zone:* High-power microwave \+ High-speed raking.  
  4. *Retrogradation Zone:* Chill tunnel with agitation to separate grains before packaging.

**5\. Methodological Framework: The "Perfect Couscous" Algorithm**

The patent claims will protect the specific algorithmic sequence that synchronizes the hardware components. This method is defined by four critical phases.

### **Phase 1: Lipid Intercalation**

* **Input:** Dry semolina (e.g., 500g), Lipid (e.g., 60ml Olive Oil).  
* **Process:** The agitator operates in **Mode A (Tumble)**. The microwave is pulsed at low power (10%) to warm the oil to approx. 40°C, lowering its viscosity and enhancing spreadability.  
* **Science:** This ensures every granule is encapsulated. The mild heat initiates the formation of the amylose-lipid complex precursors.5

### **Phase 2: Staged Gradient Hydration**

* **Input:** Water/Broth (e.g., 600ml total).  
* **Cycle 1 (The "Wake Up"):** 25% of water is injected via the perimeter manifold. The microwave runs at 50% power for 2 minutes. Agitator in **Mode B (De-agglomeration)**. This generates a peripheral steam ring that migrates inward.  
* **Cycle 2 & 3 (The "Swell"):** Remaining water is added in pulses. The microwave power is modulated to keep the bulk temperature just below boiling (95°C) to prevent aggressive turbulence that damages granules.  
* **Agitation:** The vertical tines puncture the bed continuously, preventing the formation of a steam-seal crust on the surface.

### **Phase 3: Gelatinization & Fluffing**

* **Process:** No new water is added. The system utilizes the absorbed water to finish gelatinization.  
* **Agitation:** **Mode C (Lift/Fluff)** is engaged. The bottom-most granules are lifted to the top to allow excess moisture to flash off. This mimics the "steaming" phase of the traditional couscousier.  
* **Termination Criteria:** The IR sensor detects a uniform surface temperature, and the Hygrometer 21 detects a drop in steam evolution rate (indicating free water is exhausted).

### **Phase 4: Active Retrogradation Cooling**

* **Process:** Microwave OFF. Peltier cooling / Fan ON.  
* **Agitation:** Maximum frequency vertical reciprocation.  
* **Outcome:** The temperature is dropped rapidly from 95°C to 45°C. The agitation prevents the granules from sticking as the starch recrystallizes. The result is a flowable, fluffy product ready for serving or packaging.

**6\. Expansion of Scope: Alternative Embodiments**

The utility of the HTAS extends far beyond couscous. The core claims regarding "Vertical Agitation" and "Gradient Hydration" allow for the automation of several complex traditional foods.

### **6.1 Automated "Dum" Biryani (The Layering Challenge)**

Traditional Biryani preparation is notoriously difficult to automate because it requires cooking meat and rice in the same pot without mixing them (layering) and steaming them together ("Dum").

* **The HTAS Solution:**  
  1. *Meat Phase:* The agitator and microwave cook the meat base (curry) at the bottom of the vessel.  
  2. *Rice Layering:* The user (or an automated hopper) adds soaked rice on top.  
  3. *Non-Destructive Hydration:* The **Perimeter Manifold** gently adds water down the sides. Because of the density difference and the gentle entry, the water floats over the meat sauce, hydrating the rice without mixing the layers.  
  4. *Ventilation:* The vertical agitator is programmed to perform "partial strokes," penetrating only the rice layer to fluff it, or creating deep "chimneys" (vents) through the rice and meat to allow steam from the meat to rise, without rotational mixing.4

### **6.2 Mochi Production (The Impact Challenge)**

Mochi (glutinous rice cake) requires pounding (impact) rather than kneading (shear) to align the starch molecules for elasticity.

* **The HTAS Solution:** The system is equipped with a high-torque linear actuator. The standard fork head is replaced with a solid **Pestle Head**.  
* **Process:** The actuator drives the pestle down with high velocity (Impact Mode), compressing the steamed rice mass against the vessel bottom. The vessel rotates slightly between strikes. This automates the traditional *Usu* and *Kine* pounding process 23, which rotary blade mixers (like Thermomix) cannot replicate without cutting the gluten strands.

### **6.3 Hand-Pulled Noodle Dough (The Stretching Challenge)**

Noodle dough requires the development of a longitudinal gluten network, achieved traditionally by stretching and folding.

* **The HTAS Solution:** Using **Mode C (Lift and Drop)**.  
* **Process:** The tines engage the dough mass, lift it vertically to the top of the chamber (stretching it under gravity), and then lower it to fold over. This "Stretch-Fold-Rotate" cycle develops the gluten chains uniaxially, mimicking the hand-pulling mechanic.25

### **6.4 Fermented Batters (Idli/Dosa)**

These batters require precise temperature maintenance (30°C ± 2°C) for fermentation and aeration.

* **The HTAS Solution:** The microwave can be pulsed at extremely low duty cycles (or the Peltier element reversed to heat mode) to maintain the incubation temperature. The vertical agitator periodically whisks air into the batter to promote yeast activity and volume.27

**7\. Strategic Patent Roadmap and Gap Analysis**

### **7.1 Patent Landscape and Freedom to Operate**

The patent search conducted identifies a crowded field in general food processing but a distinct "white space" around the *synchronization* of microwave energy with vertical mechanical agitation.

* **US5427809A (Donnelly et al.):** Covers couscous via extrusion. **Differentiation:** Our process is non-extrusion; it handles discrete granules.  
* **US7485830B2 (Kim):** Covers a rotating cooking vessel. **Differentiation:** Our vessel may be static; the novelty is the *vertical* agitation which avoids the shear stress of rotation.  
* **US4664924A (Sugisawa et al.):** Covers microwave drying. **Differentiation:** We claim the entire cooking/gelatinization cycle, specifically the lipid-complexing phase, not just drying.  
* **US7174720B2 (Pardo):** Covers Peltier cooking. **Differentiation:** We use Peltier specifically for the *retrogradation* phase of starch, a method claim distinct from generic heating/cooling.

### **7.2 Claim Construction Strategy**

To maximize valuation and protection, the patent application will be structured with three primary independent claims targeting different aspects of the technology.

#### **Claim Area 1: The Mechanical Apparatus (Hardware)**

* **Focus:** The "Vertical Reciprocating Agitator" inside a microwave cavity.  
* **Scope:** Any food processor using a linear actuator to move a tool head up and down within a resonant cavity. This protects the machine design from copycats using standard rotary motors.  
* **Key Limitation to Overcome:** Must distinguish from standard "plungers." The claim will specify "simultaneous vertical reciprocation and rotational indexing" to define the "fluffing" motion.

#### **Claim Area 2: The Hydraulic System (Hardware/Method)**

* **Focus:** The "Circumferential Liquid Distribution Manifold" creating a radial hydration gradient.  
* **Scope:** A method of hydrating particulate food in a microwave by injecting liquid at the perimeter to counteract center-heating. This is a powerful claim applicable to *any* grain cooker (rice, quinoa, oats).

#### **Claim Area 3: The "Smart" Process (Software/Method)**

* **Focus:** The use of "Torque Rheometry" to determine doneness.  
* **Scope:** A method of controlling a cooking cycle by monitoring the resistance of a mechanical agitator against the food load. If the torque curve indicates "clumping," the system autonomously alters the agitation frequency. This protects the "data" and "algorithm" aspect, crucial for the "Smart Kitchen" valuation.18

### **7.3 The "Rice Cooker Hack" as Prior Art / Embodiment 0**

The "Rice Cooker Hack" described in the setup serves as a critical Proof of Concept (PoC). In the patent specification, this can be described as an "alternative embodiment" where the heating source is resistive (conduction) rather than radiative (microwave). This broadens the patent scope to cover *all* heat sources, ensuring that a competitor cannot bypass the patent simply by swapping the magnetron for a heating element.

## ---

**8\. Commercial Implications and Market Strategy**

### **8.1 Market Positioning**

The HTAS technology addresses two distinct market segments:

1. **The "Prosumer" Kitchen:** A high-end countertop appliance (price point $400-$800) targeting the demographic that buys Vitamix or Breville. The selling point is "Restaurant Quality Traditional Foods" (Couscous, Biryani, Mochi) that serve as a culinary flex, impossible to make with an Instant Pot.  
2. **The Industrial Retrofit:** A licensing play for major food lines (Nestle, Barilla). The technology can be retrofitted into existing microwave tempering tunnels 19 to produce "Premium Frozen Couscous" that isn't a solid block of ice but individual frozen granules, commanding a higher SKU price.

### **8.2 The "Smart Kitchen" Data Play**

By securing the claims on sensor feedback (Claim Area 3), the invention becomes a data-generation platform.

* **Rheological Fingerprinting:** The machine learns the "stiffness curve" of different grain brands.  
* **Business Model:** A "Nespresso for Grains" model. The user scans a QR code on a bag of premium semolina. The machine downloads the specific "Agitation Profile" (e.g., "Gentle Tumble" for brand X, "Vigorous Forking" for brand Y) to ensure perfect results. This creates a recurring revenue ecosystem.

**DETAILED PATENT SPECIFICATION: FULL TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE**

**TITLE OF THE INVENTION**

**SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATED PREPARATION OF GRANULAR STARCH-BASED FOOD PRODUCTS VIA STAGED HYDRO-THERMAL AGITATION**

## **FIELD OF THE INVENTION**

The present disclosure relates generally to food processing apparatuses and methods. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to an automated electromechanical system for the preparation of granular food products, such as couscous, semolina, rice, and ancient grains. The system integrates microwave dielectric heating, circumferential fluid distribution, and multi-vector mechanical agitation to optimize starch gelatinization, lipid-amylose complex formation, and textural integrity.

## **BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION**

Couscous, a staple food made from durum wheat semolina, is traditionally prepared through a multi-stage process that is labor-intensive and requires significant skill. The artisanal method involves: (1) hydrating semolina with water; (2) mechanical "rolling" or "rubbing" by hand to form granules and prevent clumping; (3) steaming the granules; (4) removing the granules to add lipids (oil/butter) and water; (5) mechanical "fluffing" to break agglomerations; and (6) repeating the steaming process. This cycle allows for the gradual swelling of starch granules without them fusing into a unitary mass.

**Failure of Existing Solutions:** Existing automated solutions fail to replicate this delicate balance.

* **Industrial Extrusion:** Large-scale manufacturing (e.g., US Patent 5,427,809) utilizes extrusion technology. Semolina is mixed into a dough, extruded through a die, and cut into pellets. While efficient, this "pasta-like" process creates a dense product that lacks the light, porous texture of rolled couscous. The high temperatures and pressures of extrusion can also shear the protein network, reducing the bite or "al dente" quality.6  
* **Home Automation:** Domestic kitchen robots (e.g., stand mixers with heating elements, or devices like the Thermomix) utilize rotary blades positioned at the bottom of a bowl. When applied to couscous, the high shear velocity of the blades fractures the delicate hydrated granules, releasing amylopectin and creating a sticky paste. Furthermore, these devices typically employ conduction heating (heating from the bottom), which requires a large volume of water to prevent burning, effectively boiling the couscous rather than steaming it.3  
* **Microwave Cooking:** Microwave ovens are efficient for heating water but poor at cooking granular starch uniformly. The standing wave patterns in a microwave cavity create "hot spots" where granules may burn or dissolve, and "cold spots" where they remain raw. Additionally, the rapid heating of water in the center of the food mass often causes "boil-over" or the formation of a dense, starchy core that cannot be broken up post-cooking.5

Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus that can automate the couscous preparation process by managing the *physicochemical environment* of the starch granule—specifically controlling hydration kinetics, lipid coating, and mechanical separation—without manual intervention.

## **SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION**

The present invention addresses the foregoing needs by providing a "Hydro-Thermal Agitation System." This system replaces the manual "rubbing and fluffing" of tradition with a precision-controlled **vertical reciprocating agitation mechanism** and replaces the "steaming" with a **pulsed microwave-hydro-gradient method**.

**The Lipid Barrier:** The method begins by coating dry granules with lipids prior to hydration. Under microwave heating, these lipids complex with amylose (starch), reducing the solubility of the starch and preventing stickiness (retrogradation inhibition during cooking, promotion during cooling).

**Radial Hydration:** Water is introduced via a **circumferential manifold** at the rim of the vessel. This directs water down the vessel walls and into the periphery of the food bed. This counters the microwave's tendency to heat the center most aggressively, creating a balanced thermal-moisture distribution.

**Vertical "Forking":** The agitator does not stir in a circle; it reciprocates vertically (up and down). This motion mimics a fork breaking up clumps. It introduces air voids into the food mass, allowing steam to escape and preventing the formation of a dense cake.

## **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS**

Hardware Architecture:  
Referring to FIG. 1, the apparatus comprises a housing defining a microwave-resonant cavity . A microwave generator (magnetron or solid-state RF source) is coupled to the cavity via a waveguide .  
Disposed within the cavity is a cooking vessel . The vessel is preferably cylindrical with a concave or conical bottom to facilitate the centering of dry ingredients. The vessel is constructed of a microwave-transparent material having a low dielectric loss factor (e.g., borosilicate glass, Ultem, or PEEK).  
The Agitation System:  
Suspended from the ceiling of the cavity is the Agitation Assembly . The assembly comprises a drive shaft that penetrates the cavity wall through a wave choke (a structure designed to attenuate microwave leakage).  
The distal end of the shaft is coupled to a Tool Head . In the preferred embodiment for couscous, the Tool Head comprises a "Fork Array" : a plurality of vertical tines extending downward.  
The drive mechanism is located outside the cavity (in the "attic" of the appliance). It comprises:

1. **Rotary Motor :** Provides low-speed angular indexing (0-30 RPM).  
2. Linear Actuator : Provides high-speed vertical reciprocation (0-300 strokes per minute, or 5 Hz).  
   This combination allows the tines to "poke," "lift," and "index," covering the entire volume of the vessel without the continuous shear of a rotary blade.

The Fluid Distribution System:  
Referring to FIG. 2, the Circumferential Liquid Distribution Manifold is an annular ring integrated into the upper housing or the vessel lid.  
The manifold comprises a plurality of nozzles (e.g., 8 nozzles spaced at 45° intervals).  
Crucially, the nozzles are oriented at an angle \[θ\] (Theta) relative to the vessel wall . This angle is selected such that the fluid stream impinges on the vessel wall above the fill line of the food product. This creates a "falling film" of water that travels down the wall and enters the food mass from the perimeter .

* *Advantage:* This pre-heats the water (via dielectric heating of the film) and hydrates the peripheral granules which are typically the driest in microwave cooking due to evaporative cooling at the edges.7

Sensor Suite:  
The system includes:

1. **Infrared Matrix Sensor :** Positioned in the cavity ceiling to monitor the surface temperature distribution of the food bed.17  
2. **Torque Feedback Sensor :** Measures the current draw of the Linear Actuator . High current indicates high resistance (i.e., stiff clumps).  
3. **Humidity/Steam Sensor :** Located in the exhaust vent to detect the "break point" where free water is exhausted and steam rate drops.21

### **METHOD OF OPERATION (THE "ALGORITHM")**

**Phase 1: Lipid Intercalation (The "Pre-Coat")**

* *Action:* User loads dry semolina (e.g., 250g) into the vessel. System dispenses oil (e.g., 15ml) via the manifold.  
* *Agitation:* Rotary Motor spins at 20 RPM; Linear Actuator is static or slowly undulating.  
* *Physics:* This coats the granules. Upon initial microwave heating (applied in Phase 2), the lipids form inclusion complexes with the amylose helices on the surface of the granules.5 This "waterproofs" the surface slightly, forcing water to penetrate the core slowly rather than dissolving the surface.

**Phase 2: Gradient Hydration (The "Drink")**

* *Action:* Microwave power is set to 50%. Water is injected in pulses (e.g., 3 x 50ml cycles).  
* *Flow Path:* Water enters from the *perimeter* via the Manifold . It migrates toward the center via capillary action.  
* *Agitation:* Linear Actuator begins "De-agglomeration Mode" (2 Hz frequency). The tines puncture the bed, creating vertical channels. This allows water to wick into the center and steam to vent out, preventing a "pressure cooker" effect in the core.

**Phase 3: Gelatinization & Expansion (The "Cook")**

* *Action:* Microwave power cycles to maintain mass temperature at 98°C.  
* *Agitation:* "Lift Mode" is engaged. The tines plunge, rotate 10 degrees, and retract. This lifts the bottom layer (which may be wetter) to the top.  
* *Physics:* The starch granules swell (gelatinize). The lipid barrier prevents them from fusing. The vertical agitation ensures that the "tacky" phase does not result in a solid cake.

**Phase 4: Active Retrogradation (The "Set")**

* *Action:* Microwave is OFF. A cooling fan or Peltier element is activated.13  
* *Agitation:* Maximum frequency (4-5 Hz) vertical reciprocation.  
* *Physics:* Rapid cooling induces retrogradation (recrystallization) of the amylose. By agitating *during* this cooling, the bonds form *within* the granule, not *between* granules. This creates the "fluffy" texture where grains roll apart individually.

## **ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS**

Industrial Continuous Tunnel:  
In an industrial embodiment, the "Cavity" is an elongated microwave tunnel.19 The "Vessel" is a conveyor belt. The "Agitation Assembly" is replaced by a series of gantry-mounted rakes that reciprocate transversely across the belt. The "Manifold" comprises spray bars located at intervals along the tunnel length, establishing the hydration gradient over time (distance) rather than cycles.20  
Application to "Dum" Cooking (Biryani):  
The control unit is programmed to execute a "Layered Mode." The agitator's vertical stroke is limited to the upper Z-axis range. This allows the system to fluff the rice layer on top without disturbing the meat/sauce layer at the bottom.22 The manifold adds water only to the periphery, where it trickles down to create steam at the bottom, mimicking the "Dum" (sealed pot) steaming technique.4  
Application to Mochi (Pounding):  
The Fork Array is replaced with a solid "Pestle" attachment. The Linear Actuator operates in "Impact Mode," driving the pestle into the glutinous rice mass with high force to mechanically align the starch polymers, creating the characteristic elasticity of Mochi.23

**End of Patent Specification**

## **11\. Final Strategic Recommendations for the Inventor**

1. **Terminology is Key:** In your final filing, avoid the word "Couscous." Use "Granular Starch Material" or "Particulate Foodstuff." This broadens the scope to include quinoa, bulgur, rice, and potentially pharmaceutical granules.  
2. **The "Fork" is the Shield:** The vertical reciprocating motion is your strongest differentiator against the "blenders" and "mixers" of the world. Defend this mechanism aggressively. It is mechanically distinct from rotation.  
3. **Invest in the Manifold:** The "Perimeter Hydration" claim is powerful for microwave cooking in general. It solves the "cold edge/hot center" problem. This could be licensed to microwave manufacturers as a standalone feature ("The Even-Hydration Ring").  
4. **Prototype the "Mochi Mode":** If the same hardware can make Fluffy Couscous *and* Chewy Mochi just by changing the software and the tool head, you have a "Kitchen Platform," not just a unit tasker. This increases the valuation significantly for investors.
