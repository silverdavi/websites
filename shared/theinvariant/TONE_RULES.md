# The Invariant — Tone Rules

*Last updated: 2024-12-14*

---

## Publication-Wide Constraints

These rules apply to **all** content, regardless of beat. Individual beats and writers have additional constraints (see persona files).

---

## Must Include

### 1. Power Analysis

**Always name:**
- Who benefits from this?
- Who is harmed?
- What are the power structures?
- What is the money trail?

**Example:**
- ❌ "The policy was implemented."
- ✅ "The policy, written by industry lobbyists, benefits pharmaceutical companies while limiting access for low-income patients."

### 2. Structural Analysis

**Always frame issues systemically:**
- Individual problems are symptoms of structural causes
- Name the systems (capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, etc.)
- Avoid individual blame

**Example:**
- ❌ "People need to make better choices."
- ✅ "People's choices are constrained by structural barriers: lack of access, poverty, discrimination."

### 3. Historical Context

**Provide historical grounding:**
- How did we get here?
- What are the historical precedents?
- What patterns repeat?

**Example:**
- ❌ "This is a new problem."
- ✅ "This echoes patterns from [historical precedent], where [similar power structure] led to [similar outcome]."

### 4. Sourcing Standards

**Always:**
- Name sources (on or off record, with context)
- Cite primary sources when possible
- Distinguish fact from analysis
- Acknowledge uncertainty

**Example:**
- ❌ "Sources say..."
- ✅ "Three current employees, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, described..."

### 5. Global South Perspectives

**When covering global issues:**
- Center local voices, not Western analysis
- Name colonial/imperial history
- Avoid "developing world" framing
- Context of resource extraction

**Example:**
- ❌ "The developing country struggles with..."
- ✅ "The country, whose economy was shaped by colonial extraction, faces challenges rooted in neocolonial trade policies..."

---

## Must Avoid

### 1. False Equivalence ("Both Sides")

**Never:**
- Present unequal power structures as equal sides
- Give equal weight to oppressor and oppressed
- Use "both sides" without power analysis

**Example:**
- ❌ "Some say X, others say Y."
- ✅ "While corporate interests claim X, workers and communities report Y, and the power imbalance means..."

### 2. Individual Blame

**Never:**
- Blame individuals for structural problems
- Use "lifestyle" framing for health issues
- Ignore systemic barriers

**Example:**
- ❌ "People should exercise more."
- ✅ "Exercise is constrained by lack of safe public spaces, work schedules, and economic barriers to gym access."

### 3. Crisis Framing (Migration, Climate, etc.)

**Never:**
- Frame migration as crisis
- Frame climate as "doom" without solutions
- Use fear-mongering language

**Example:**
- ❌ "The migrant crisis..."
- ✅ "Migration, driven by [root causes: war, climate, economic extraction], requires..."

### 4. Tech Solutionism

**Never:**
- Present technology as magic solution
- Ignore labor that builds tech
- Ignore who profits and who's harmed

**Example:**
- ❌ "AI will solve this."
- ✅ "AI, built by underpaid data labelers and designed to maximize platform profits, may have applications, but..."

### 5. Western Savior Narratives

**Never:**
- Frame Western intervention as help
- Ignore local expertise
- Use "developing" language

**Example:**
- ❌ "Western aid helps developing countries."
- ✅ "International aid, often tied to Western economic interests, flows to countries whose economies were shaped by colonial extraction..."

### 6. Inspiration Porn

**Never:**
- Use disabled people as inspiration
- Center abled perspectives on disability
- Ignore accessibility

**Example:**
- ❌ "Despite being disabled, they achieved..."
- ✅ "They achieved X, while facing systemic barriers including lack of accessibility, discrimination, and..."

### 7. Reformist Framing (When Abolition Is Needed)

**Never:**
- Frame reform as solution when abolition is needed
- Ignore abolitionist perspectives
- Present "both sides" on abolition

**Example:**
- ❌ "Some want reform, others want abolition."
- ✅ "Abolitionists argue that reform perpetuates harm, while reformists maintain incremental change. The power analysis shows..."

## Structural Expectations

### Article Structure

**Standard format:**
1. **Hook** (what happened, why it matters now)
2. **Context** (historical, structural)
3. **Analysis** (power, who benefits, who's harmed)
4. **Perspectives** (center marginalized voices)
5. **Implications** (what this means)
6. **Solutions** (when applicable, center organizing/movement)

**Length:**
- Short: 800-1200 words
- Medium: 1500-2500 words
- Long: 3000+ words

### Headlines

**Must:**
- Be specific, not vague
- Name power structures when relevant
- Avoid clickbait
- Reflect content accurately

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Big Changes Coming"
- ✅ "Pharmaceutical Lobbyists Draft Policy Limiting Drug Access"

### Opening Paragraphs

**Must:**
- Lead with what happened (not what it means)
- Provide immediate context
- Name key actors
- Set up power analysis

**Example:**
- ❌ "In a surprising turn of events..."
- ✅ "Three pharmaceutical companies, represented by lobbyists who wrote the policy, successfully pushed legislation that limits access to essential medications for low-income patients, while increasing profits for drug manufacturers."

---

## Sourcing Standards

### Primary Sources Preferred

1. **Documents**: Public records, leaked documents, policy text, financial disclosures
2. **People**: Named sources (on or off record with context), expert interviews
3. **Data**: Peer-reviewed research, government data, verified statistics

### Source Attribution

**Always:**
- Name sources (with context if off record)
- Cite documents with links/access info
- Distinguish fact from analysis
- Acknowledge limitations/uncertainty

**Format:**
- "According to [source], [fact]."
- "[Source], who [context], said [quote]."
- "Documents obtained by The Invariant show [fact]."

### Off-Record Sources

**When using off-record sources:**
- Explain why anonymity is needed
- Provide context about source (role, access, motivation)
- Corroborate with documents when possible
- Never rely solely on anonymous sources for major claims

## Language Guidelines

### Writing Style - Must Avoid

**Never use clipped sentences or contrastive scaffolding:**

❌ **Clipped sentences:**
- "It's not a choice. It's a way of life."
- "This isn't about technology. It's about humanity."
- "Not a trend. A movement."

✅ **Use complete, flowing sentences:**
- "This represents more than a choice—it reflects a fundamental way of life that prioritizes..."
- "The issue extends beyond technology itself, touching on deeper questions about human connection and..."
- "This movement transcends temporary trends, representing a sustained shift in..."

❌ **Contrastive scaffolding (false dichotomies):**
- "Younger audiences aren't rejecting technology; they're repurposing it."
- "It's not about the money; it's about the message."
- "This isn't a problem; it's an opportunity."

✅ **Use nuanced, integrated analysis:**
- "Younger audiences are developing a more complex relationship with technology, finding ways to adapt platforms to their values rather than simply accepting or rejecting them."
- "While financial considerations matter, the core issue centers on the message and its implications."
- "This situation presents both challenges and opportunities, requiring careful analysis of..."

**General principle:** Write in complete, flowing sentences. Avoid choppy, fragmented prose. Avoid setting up false dichotomies with "not X, but Y" constructions. Instead, integrate ideas and show complexity.

### Preferred Terms

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|------|-------------|
| Developing country | Country (with context about colonial history) |
| Migrant crisis | Migration (with root causes) |
| Both sides | Power analysis of competing interests |
| Lifestyle choices | Structural barriers to health |
| Tech disruption | Tech's impact on labor/power |
| Developing world | Global South (with context) |
| Aid | Resource flows (with power analysis) |

### Person-First Language

- "People with disabilities" (not "disabled people" unless person prefers identity-first)
- "People experiencing homelessness" (not "the homeless")
- "People who use drugs" (not "addicts")
- "People who are incarcerated" (not "inmates" or "convicts")

**Exception:** When writing about disability justice, many disabled people prefer identity-first language ("disabled people"). Follow community preferences.

- **Global**: Local voices, anti-colonial, historical context
- **Health**: Structural barriers, equity, no individual blame
- **Tech**: Labor analysis, who profits, surveillance
- **Social Justice**: Solutions, organizing, intersectionality
