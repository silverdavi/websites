Enhanced depth mapping using visual inertial odometry
Patent number: 12153140
Abstract: Imaging apparatus (22) includes a radiation source (40), which emits pulsed beams (42) of optical radiation toward a target scene (24). An array (52) of sensing elements outputs signals indicative of respective times of incidence of photons on the sensing elements. Objective optics (54) form a first image of the target scene on the array of sensing elements. An image sensor (64) captures a second image of the target scene. Processing and control circuitry (56, 58) is configured to process the second image so as to detect a relative motion between at least one object in the target scene and the apparatus, and which is configured to construct, responsively to the signals from the array, histograms of the times of incidence of the photons on the sensing elements and to adjust the histograms responsively to the detected relative motion, and to generate a depth map of the target scene based on the adjusted histograms.

Calibration of a depth sensing array using color image data
Patent number: 11914078
Abstract: Imaging apparatus (22) includes a radiation source (40), which emits pulsed beams (42) of optical radiation toward a target scene (24). An array (52) of sensing elements (78) output signals indicative of respective times of incidence of photons in a first image of the target scene that is formed on the array of sensing elements. An image sensor (64) captures a second image of the target scene in registration with the first image. Processing and control circuitry (56, 58) identifies, responsively to the signals, areas of the array on which the pulses of optical radiation reflected from corresponding regions of the target scene are incident, and processes the signals from the sensing elements in the identified areas in order measure depth coordinates of the corresponding regions of the target scene based on the times of incidence, while identifying, responsively to the second image, one or more of the regions of the target scene as no-depth regions.
