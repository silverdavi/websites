## 🔴 STILL MISSING (Blocking)

### 1. UEI Number (SAM.gov Registration)
**Status:** Not obtained  
**Impact:** Cannot submit without this

**Action:** 
1. Go to sam.gov
2. Register Kernel Keys LLC
3. Takes 1-2 weeks — **start immediately**

---

### 2. Customer Conversations (≥10)
**Status:** None documented  
**Impact:** **Biggest weakness** — NSF reviewers specifically look for this

You need documented conversations with:
- Makers / hobbyists
- STEM educators  
- Robotics startup founders
- Dev-board resellers

**Action:**
1. Reach out to 15 people this week
2. Schedule 10+ calls over next 2 weeks
3. Document: name, role, pain points, interest level (1-5)
4. Ask: "Would you pilot this if it existed?"

**Target contacts:**
- Arduino/ESP32 community Discord moderators
- Local robotics clubs / FIRST mentors
- Hardware startup founders (YC, AngelList)
- Adafruit/SparkFun community managers
- University EE/CS lab instructors

---

### 3. Named Consultants with Commitments
**Status:** Roles defined, names TBD  
**Impact:** Weakens team section; need letters of commitment

Need:
1. **Embedded systems expert** — real-time scheduling, safety-critical
2. **Dev-tools/UX specialist** — programming language usability

**Action:**
1. Post on relevant Slack/Discord communities
2. Reach out to former colleagues
3. Check consulting platforms (Toptal, etc.)
4. Get verbal commitment + willingness to write 1-paragraph letter

---

### 4. PI Official Email
**Status:** TBD  
**Impact:** Minor, but needed for forms

**Action:** Set up david@kernel-keys.com or similar

---

## ✅ BUDGET COMPLETE

### 5. Salary/Fringe/Indirect Rates
**Status:** ✅ Complete

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| PI annual salary | $140,000 |
| Fringe benefits rate | 25% |
| Indirect rate | 30% (provisional) |
| Compiler Engineer | $110,000/year |
| Firmware Engineer | $95,000/year |

---

### 6. Equipment Costs
**Status:** ✅ Complete ($12,982 total)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| MacBook M4 Max 16" (64GB, 1TB) | $4,499 |
| GPU Workstation (PC) | $2,800 |
| NVIDIA RTX 5090 × 2 | $4,398 |
| ESP32/Arduino/Pico boards | $435 |
| Sensors, actuators, test equipment | $850 |

---

## 🟢 OPTIONAL (Strengthen Proposal)

### 7. Preliminary Prototype
**Status:** None ("design explored in diagrams")  
**Impact:** Would significantly strengthen technical credibility

Even a minimal demo helps:
- Simple DSL grammar (BNF on paper)
- Python parser for the grammar
- "Hello world" bytecode → LED blink on ESP32

**Action:** If time permits before submission, build something minimal

---

### 8. Named Advisory Board
**Status:** TBD  
**Impact:** Adds credibility but not required

Nice to have advisors from:
- Embedded systems academia
- Robotics industry
- STEM education

**Action:** Think about former professors, industry contacts

---

### 9. Specific Market Numbers
**Status:** Generic ("30-40B MCUs")  
**Impact:** More specifics help commercialization section

Research:
- Arduino board sales per year
- ESP32 community size
- Educational robotics market growth rate
- Specific competitor pricing

**Action:** 30-min research session for 5 specific stats with sources
