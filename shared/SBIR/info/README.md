## Problem Summary

Programming microcontrollers requires:
- Hand-written C/C++
- Low-level memory management
- Device-specific registers
- Manual GPIO configuration
- No abstraction for intent

**Missing:** A middle-level abstraction between natural language and C code that is safe, deterministic, compact, and runnable on $1 MCUs.
