You’re aiming to map out activities that are *normally* personal and nondeductible, but plausibly deductible *for you*, given:

* your actual research output (Taskmaster paper, WILTY deception-detection work, exponential-map paper, machine learning, etc.),
* your actual business lines (Kernel Keys LLC: ML/AI solutions; Remiza LTD: data-driven product consulting; AKA-Foods ownership: vegan food R&D),
* and your public-facing science-communication and empirical-research workflow.

Below is a direct list of categories and sub-activities that a tax advisor can classify as “ordinary and necessary” for your specific business profile when properly documented.

## Media, Data, and Experimental Consumption

Activities ordinarily treated as personal entertainment but *become deductible* when tied to research output, data collection, or publication.

### Television / Video

* Watching competitive reality shows as part of deception-detection, sentiment-analysis, or game-dynamics research.
* Archiving episodes, annotating scenes, labeling body-language cues, reaction timing, editing styles.
* Running viewer-survey tests or LLM-based annotation audits with controlled volunteers.
* Dataset creation (cuts, transcripts, embeddings, labeling).
* Using the material for measurable output (papers, benchmarks, models).

### General Online Media

* Consuming and classifying online content for algorithmic-bias research (political persuasion, social media deception, attention patterns).
* Collecting data for building a KB or embedding space for your voice-interaction platform.
* Content used in your science-communication book or Kickstarter updates.

## Food, Cooking, and Ingredient Costs

Ordinarily nondeductible (personal consumption). For you, existing ownership in AKA-Foods and active product development shifts this to R&D.

### Vegan Food R&D

* Testing ingredient formulations for AKA-Foods prototypes (textures, emulsification, protein structures, taste optimization).
* Running split-tests on recipe variants.
* Recording sensory data with small focus groups.
* Nutritional profiling workflows.
* Equipment and ingredient costs directly tied to prototype creation.
* Packaging tests, shelf-life experiments, freeze-thaw stability (relates to your concentrated broth work as well).
* Documentation for product-market fit experiments.

### Autonomous Couscous Maker (Active R&D Project)

* Developing a modified rice-cooker-based system for autonomous couscous production.
* Hardware prototyping: motor selection (gear motors, BBQ spit motors), food-grade shaft/paddle design, steam sealing mechanisms.
* Process control research: hydration timing, agglomeration mechanics, timed steaming cycles, clump-breaking automation.
* Physicochemical study: starch gelatinization parameters, protein network formation, amylose-lipid complexation.
* Equipment purchases: rice cookers for modification, motors, food-grade materials (stainless steel shafts, silicone seals, PTFE bushings), digital timers, temperature sensors.
* Ingredient costs for iterative testing: durum wheat semolina variants, oils for finishing.
* Documentation of experimental protocols and results for potential patent/publication.

## Science Communication and Public Education

Normally nondeductible (general learning or media creation). For you, it is tied to a monetized book, Kickstarter campaign, and public brand.

### Book Production (50-chapter project)

* Reading source literature for chapter development.
* Consuming historical material, lectures, and papers.
* Drafting illustration concepts.
* Building datasets for technical diagrams (e.g., Cayley graphs, band-theory plots).
* Reviewing emerging research for accuracy in GSM, GR, topology, supernova cosmology, mitochondrial inheritance, etc.
* On-camera practice sessions for future reels.

### Reels / Video Production for Science Topics

* Camera and sound equipment.
* Background sets, lighting, and props.
* Research time for preparing scientifically precise scripts.
* Asset creation (floating figures, animations).
* Performance tests with small audiences.

## AI, ML, and Data-Engineering Workflows

Anything that looks like “personal experimentation” is deductible when used to produce commercial ML systems or publishable technical work.

### Model and Pipeline Development

* Collecting audio samples, video samples, or interaction logs for your speech-to-speech AI stack.
* Experimentation with LLM tools for KB management.
* Implementing models for your deception-detection research.
* Taskmaster trajectory modeling experiments.

### Hardware and Software

* GPUs, local dev rigs, NAS storage, backup servers (your ASUSTOR NAS and SFTP/rsync setup).
* Training data acquisition and annotation tools.
* Cloud compute for GCP/LLM proofs of concept.
* Paid APIs for Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama testing.

---

## Field Experiments and Productization Tests

Personal consumer purchases become deductible when used as part of product development or customer-experience research.

### Consumer Testing

* Running structured user tests for interactive voice systems.
* Home experiments for UI/UX of AKA-Foods packaging or cooking instructions.
* Structured observation of how kids or laypeople understand certain science explanations (ties into your book and reels).

---

## Travel Connected to Research or Business

Normally nondeductible unless specifically tied to business deliverables.

### Business-Driven Travel

* Travel to a location for gathering observational data (e.g., filming environmental shots for educational reels).
* Visits to collaborators for research meetings (ML, food-tech, media-analysis).
* Attending conferences where your research is directly relevant.

---

## Miscellaneous Categories That Flip From Personal to Business

### Everyday Communication Platforms

* WhatsApp backups, note-taking tools, signal-processing apps used for your research and client documentation.

### Education Material

* Courses, journals, books, and paid subscriptions that support AI/ML, food-tech, or science-communication output.

### Experimental Purchases

* Props or physical items used to demonstrate concepts in your book or in public science videos.
* Board games, logic puzzles, or probability tools used to illustrate Arrow’s Theorem, the Envelope Paradox, etc.
