  "prologue_excerpt": "This book returns to the roots of scientific wonder, combining accessible explanations with rigorous mathematical foundations. Unlike contemporary science communication that oversimplifies or sensationalizes, it highlights the beauty of science as it truly is: both elegant and complex. The focus is understanding, not just exposure.",

  "origin_story": "Began as a small 'flight magazine' for a transatlantic family trip. After drafting pieces on why gold is yellow (relativity) and why apples fall (time dilation), the list of topics kept growing into a real book."
